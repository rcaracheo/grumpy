# Grumpy jupyter kernel

A Jupyter kernel that allows you to write code in any language, and provides
positive and constructive feedback.

Presented in the lightning talks of [PyLondinium 2018](https://pylondinium.org).

It uses sophisticated deep learning, blockchain, IoT, big data, and many more
cutting-edge technologies, all implemented in 7 `if` conditions.

Based on the [echo_kernel](https://github.com/jupyter/echo_kernel)..

Not sure why anyone would like to install it, but the next should work:

- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
- `conda install jupyter`
- `jupyter kernelspec install <path-to-repo>/grumpy_kernel`
- `PYTHONPATH=<path-to-repo> jupyter notebook`
